			Not marble, nor the gilded monuments Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme; But you shall shine more
			bright in these contents Than unswept stone, besmeard with sluttish time. When wasteful war shall statues
			overturn, And broils root out the work of masonry, Nor Mars his sword, nor wars quick fire shall burn The
			living record of your memory. Gainst death, and all-oblivious enmity Shall you pace forth; your praise shall
			still find room
